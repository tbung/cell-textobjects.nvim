# ipy-textobjects.nvim

This plugin adds textobjects for code in a cell, i.e. code between two lines of comments
containing a delimiter string.

TODO: Add gif of the plugin at work

It's designed with the jupytext percent format in mind, but is not limited to this format, and
especially does not require jupytext.vim.

## Setup

## Configuration

## Recommended Plugins
- jupytext.vim for directly opening ipynb files as python files with cell delimiters
- magma-nvim for running code snippets as cells
